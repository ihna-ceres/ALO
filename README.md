# Welcome to ALO !

AI Learning Organizer (ALO) is a specialized framework designed to streamline and simplify the development of AI Solutions. By following the ALO guide, assets are developed and connected into a single ML pipeline for training and inference experiments. Once completed, the solution is containerized through a solution registration Jupyter Notebook, making full use of meerkat's rich resources. Once registered as a meerkat solution, multiple users can easily request AI training and deploy to Edge Devices.
